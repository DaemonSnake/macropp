-make __POSTFIX__(@ --- @) not match in look and balenced for '(' ')'

-new instructions:
     -> @FUNCTION //@foreach, @args, @if, @else, @elseif etc...
     -> @CALL
     -> @EVAL
     -> @LIST

-make look behave as follows:
     -> __POSTFIX__(@LOOK MOTIF @, AFTER @, BEFORE [@, ALT]* @)

     -> Balenced from char to string to handle correctly '(@' and '@)'
