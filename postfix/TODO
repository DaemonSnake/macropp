-new instructions:
     -> @FUNCTION //@foreach, @args, @if, @else, @elseif etc...
     -> @CALL
     -> @EVAL //math
     -> @LIST //push_back, front, pop_front, pop_back, etc...
     -> @PUSH_RULE and @SEEK
     -> @SWITCH
                // the first that matches is the one selected
                // [@SWITCH [@LOOK ; @, @, [@MACRO class_prototype @] @] @, [@LOOK { @, @, [@ [@MACRO end_class @] @] @]
     -> @FALLBACK
                // if the first command doesn't work, fall on the other
                // [@FALLBACK [@ [@MACRO end_class @] @] @, [@LOOK ; @, @, [@MACRO class_prototype @] @] @]

-make look behave as follows:
     -> [@LOOK MOTIF @, AFTER @, BEFORE [@, ALT]* @]
                          where ALT is an alternative before reading
     -> Balenced from char to string to handle correctly '(@' and '@)'


ISSUES:
        -macro name should allow string as names
        -Transfer buffer back once finished instead of writing it all (look.c)
        -cpp without -P ?????
        -handling of ignoring strings is not really functional

INTEROGATIONS:
        -handle '\377' and 'xFF' for format
