-new instructions:
     -> @FUNCTION //@foreach, @args, @if, @else, @elseif etc...
     -> @CALL
     -> @EVAL //math
     -> @LIST //push_back, front, pop_front, pop_back, etc...
     -> @PUSH_RULE and @SEEK
     -> @SWITCH
                // the first that matches is the one selected
                // [@SWITCH [@LOOK ; @, @, [@MACRO class_prototype @] @] @, [@ [@MACRO end_class @] @] @]

-make look behave as follows:
     -> [@LOOK MOTIF @, AFTER @, BEFORE [@, ALT]* @]
                          where ALT is an alternative before reading

-format: allow numbers after '%' to specify what argument to read

ISSUES:
        -macro name should allow string as names
        -Transfer buffer back once finished instead of writing it all (look.c)

INTEROGATIONS:
        -handle '\377' and 'xFF' for format
